github forcing the use of 2fa now. i don't own a cellphone and i won't be buying one just to create free stuff.
i won't be relying on third party password managers, or less-than-functional authentication apps either.

it was an interesting run on gitHub for like 7 years. 
not a single comment, reaction, issue report, star, feedback of any kind..
still tried sending things out there..

if i can't access any of the stuff that i've made due to github's forcing of 2fa, then none of you can either.




Very simply, this is my personal "Help" file I use very often. 

It includes many corrections for various (Debian) Linux related issues, an abundance of custom actions for Thunar File Manager, an amount of script functions that are useful, directions for simple procedures, many one liner scripts that serve some purposes.

I occasionally update this with new information or bits of script, things that are worth remembering.

Maybe someone else can find it as useful as I do.
