Very simply, this is my personal "Help" file I use very often. 

It includes many corrections for various Linux related issues, an abundance of custom actions for Thunar File Manager, an amount of script functions that are useful, directions for simple procedures, many one liner scripts that serve some purposes.

I occasionally update this with new information or bits of script, things that are worth remembering.
Maybe someone else can find it as useful as I do.
